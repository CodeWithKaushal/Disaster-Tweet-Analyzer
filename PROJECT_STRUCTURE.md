# Project Organization Summary

This document outlines the new project structure for the Disaster Tweet Analyzer. The structure follows a modular Flask application pattern that separates concerns and makes the codebase more maintainable.

# Root project files

Procfile                       # For Heroku deployment
README.md                      # Project documentation

run.py                         # Application entry point
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Modular Structure**: The application is now organized following the Flask blueprint pattern, which separates routes into logical modules.

2. **Configuration Management**: A proper config.py file has been added to handle different environments (development, testing, production).

3. **Error Handling**: Dedicated error handlers and templates have been added for common HTTP errors.

4. **Utility Functions**: Core functionality has been moved to a dedicated utils module, making it easier to test and maintain.

5. **Deployment Ready**: The Procfile has been updated for proper deployment to platforms like Heroku.

6. **Documentation**: The README.md has been enhanced with detailed installation and usage instructions.

7. **Dependency Management**: The requirements.txt file has been updated with precise version specifications.

## Running the Application

1. Make sure all dependencies are installed:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the application:

   ```
   python run.py
   ```

3. Access the application at: http://localhost:5000
