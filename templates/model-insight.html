      <ul>
        <li>
          <div>
            <time>Step 1</time> Data Collection and Initial Research: Collected disaster-related datasets from sources like Kaggle, including fields such as ID, keyword, location, and processed text. Conducted initial research to understand key disaster-related data points and trends.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <time>Step 2</time> Data Exploration and Cleaning: Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and understand the structure of the data. Applied data cleaning techniques to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and irrelevant information.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <time>Step 3</time> Data Preprocessing and Balancing: Used techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, and SMOTE to address class imbalance in the dataset. Implemented tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization for preparing text data for model training.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <time>Step 4</time> Feature Engineering: Identified and extracted key features to enhance the accuracy of predictions. Implemented custom features based on disaster-related keywords, sentiment scores, and location data.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <time>Step 5</time> Model Selection and Development: Experimented with various machine learning models, starting with Logistic Regression for basic classification. Tested and fine-tuned different algorithms to identify the best model for predicting whether a tweet is disaster-related.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <time>Step 6</time> Advanced NLP Techniques: Explored and applied tokenization methods like WordPiece and BERT to improve text representation. Integrated advanced NLP techniques to extract more context and accuracy in disaster identification.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <time>Step 7</time> Evaluation and Optimization: Evaluated the model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Fine-tuned model parameters and retrained models to achieve optimal performance.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <time>Step 8</time> Adding Disaster Details Prediction: Enhanced the model to predict additional details like disaster location, type, and sentiment. Implemented algorithms to classify tweets by disaster category (e.g., flood, earthquake) and identify the sentiment.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <time>Step 9</time> Data Visualization and Dashboard Creation: Created visualizations to present insights from the data, such as disaster frequency, location heatmaps, and sentiment trends. Designed a dashboard interface to display these visualizations, making the analysis more accessible to users.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <time>Step 10</time> Project Report and Presentation Preparation: Created a comprehensive project report detailing each stage, methods used, and results. Prepared a presentation summarizing the project’s goals, approach, and outcomes for effective communication with stakeholders.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <time>Step 11</time> Website Development and Integration: Developed a user-friendly website as a platform to showcase the project’s results and insights. Integrated the models and visualizations to create an interactive tool for disaster analysis.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <time>Step 12</time> Final Testing and Deployment: Conducted final testing of the website and models to ensure functionality and user experience. Deployed the website platform as a consolidated interface for disaster prediction, categorization, and analysis.
